# Machine learning, 2022, Fall

This course was originally composed of two courses - machine learning foundations and machine learning techniques - before.
This is a graduate-level statistical learning course that introduces learning theories, the design and analysis of learning algorithms, and some applications of machine learning with concentration on the mathematical background of models. This repository contains my solutions to the homework assignments.

Professor: [Hsuan-Tien, Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/), graduate institution of computer science and information engineering @ National Taiwan University

## Homework assignments

The homeworks of this class comprised of two parts - writing assignments and programming assignments. For writing assignments, I uploaded all my hand-written solutions in pictures to the directory of each homework. As for programming assignments, I coded in python.

- HW1: Experiments with Perceptron Learning Algorithm
- HW2: Experiments with Linear Models
- HW3: Experiments with Linear and Nonlinear Models
- HW4: Experiments with Regularized Logistic Regression
- HW5: Experiments with Soft-Margin SVM
- HW6: Experiments with Adaptive Boosting

Please refer to each homework directory for details.

## Final projects 
- We participated in a Kaggle competition - Credit Card Fraud Detection.
